#Documentation and Reporting:
""" In order to facilitate machine learning model compatibility, we used a Label Encoding model to convert categorical data into numeric representation during the project. Important findings from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) included the following: the dataset had 21 columns and 7043 entries, and the churn rate differed considerably depending on the customer's demographics and service consumption habits. Using LabelEncoder, feature engineers converted numeric values from categorical categories like gender, InternetService, and PaymentMethod. Our review of our preprocessing revealed that we could effectively apply a wide range of machine-learning methods if we converted these features. Managing categorical data effectively was one of the challenges faced, although it was lessened by methodically encoding each category column. All things considered, this preprocessing stage was essential to getting the data ready for additional modeling and analysis."""
